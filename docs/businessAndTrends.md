# Business and trends

Here all weeks questions of Wilko's lessons

## Assignment Workshop 1

This workshop deals with The telling of stories and convincing everyone to believe in it.
Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, nations, limited companies, and the internet of Things?

### Explain this statement. (50 words)

That is because we have so many stories which are true and aren’t and people believe these stories because we have the imaginary ability to associate with them. And already from the beginning people spreaded stories about what they saw and what they heard, so history emerged from these stories.

### What does this tell you about the evolution of human culture (50 words)

People started telling stories from the beginning and when a lot of people tell the same story it becomes a different story in the end. They convert it to something they can associate with and want to believe so the stories and cultures change. All the cultures you know have these kinds of stories.

## Assignment Workshop 2

This workshop we will look at the problem of climate change from different perspectives:
Economics:

- Who pays for the costs of climate damage?
- How Can IoT Combat With Climate Change?
- What happens when IoT comes into play?

IoT platforms have shown recently how they can help us in staying connected to nature, and harnessing resources for our users without having to compromise on environmental sustainability.

### Find an article on how IoT could come up with a solution (one is enough) for the problem of climate change and write a summary (100 words).

IoT sensors play a crucial role in achieving that buildings stay at net zero carbon by monitoring energy consumption, lighting, and waste elimination. However there are concerns about sensor reliability and sustainability. But researchers are exploring biodegradable sensors to fix this issue. IoT could reduce carbon emissions by up to 15% by 2030. Smart cities, electric vehicles, and efficient traffic management are also contributing to environmental preservation. IoT potentially reduces emissions by 63.5 gigatons by 2030 if all sectors participate. Early adopters across various industries have already witnessed significant improvements in energy efficiency and profitability, highlighting the potential of IoT applications.

### How do your findings fit in with the assignment of week 1 dealing with narratives. (30 words)

Some people don’t believe in climate change because it’s so new and there are no stories about that from ages ago. But others do because the government and scientists are telling us that.

## Workshop 3 Globalisation

Globalization is a political perspective that views the world as a whole.
Its cultural approach emphasizes the political and economic importance of the changing ideas of people who want to participate in a world that becomes smaller and smaller.

### Why has the globalization narrative become a globally contested issue?

There are many reasons why globalization became a globally contested issue. Some of these are the increased migration and cultural diversity in many countries and loss of jobs in countries that let their work do in other countries with lower salaries, or because technology is replacing these jobs.

### Why do competing conceptions of 'world order' have political and economic consequences?

It can lead to conflicts and between countries that have opposing views on that subject. This is something that always has an impact on politics and economics.

### Could you give some examples?

For example the war between Ukraine and Russia, this had a major impact on the grain industry because Ukraine couldn’t export it out of the country or even let it grow after a while, Also the gas prices in Europe became a lot higher because of all the sanctions for Russian gas.
Imagine for a moment that you run a business that produces the product you have in mind for the Internet of Things.

### How would globalization impact your company?

My company would prioritize fighting climate change and optimisation. So globalization would affect the way we work because of the information en technology that is out there and still gets better and better.

## Workshop 4 Access China

As we speak China is investing heavily in the Internet of Things. Mainly with investments in cutting edge technologies.

### Will China come to dominate the IoT industry in the foreseeable future?

Maybe, but I don’t think so. That is because they have experience but don’t have a very young population. They also can’t get their hands on ASML chips so they first need to invent that themselves and that also requires a lot of time.

### Will this be a threat?

If they dominate, then I don’t think this will be a threat because we also have IoT. If they wanted to spy on us and someone finds out. Europe and America will ban all these Chinese products. Military wise I also don’t think it will be a threat because China doesn’t want a war and that is because America will interfere. And atomic bombs are scary and they are also scary for them so they don’t want a war that can escalate to using these things.

### Find an article (or two) that shed a light on these two questions. Read the article(s) and write a brief commentary (50-100 words).

The article says that China’s footprint in IoT is growing and that the EU needs to pay attention to China’s IoT development. The EU needs to adapt and engage in global cooperation to navigate the complexities of the interconnected digital world, with a lot of security of course. That is because when you share it you can control and check it and have the other team not an advantage.

## Workshop 5 IoT and Global Business

Assignment: Intercultural Business Communication

This workshop seeks to provide a guide to working and communicating across cultures, and explains how your culture and language affect the ways in which you think and respond.

The successful (IT) professionals of the future will be the culturally sensitive ones.

We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before. We do not yet know just how it will unfold, but one thing is clear: the response to it must be integrated and comprehensive, involving all stakeholders of the global polity, from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society.

How to gain competitive advantage when you apply strategies that deal with the cultural differences you will encounter in any international business setting.

### Please explain briefly your own interest in Intercultural Business Communication.

I found it interesting that the communication in other cultures is so much different then in the Netherlands. I am a person of clarity and these insights could help me in the future to change my expectations of the outcome of the conversation.

### How does Intercultural Business Communication link to your IoT studies? Please give some ideas of how you could combine or apply business perspective to your selected field of studies.

I am studying CMD (Communication and Multimedia Design) where communication to the user via the user interface and interaction is very important. These insights can help me to think more about who I am communicating with and in what culture my way of communicating could cause problems.

### What was especially interesting or even surprising for you in this material? Please choose two topics, and discuss them briefly.

That the power distance in some cultures is still so big that some people are sometimes scared to say things to another person. For me it feels like it is very old-fashoined. And I never really thought about uncertainty avoidance, this was an eye opener with the story about the greeks. And will definitely have an impact on how I give things to coworkers in the future.

## Workshop 6 Circular Economy

### Describe what the circular economy is and how the Internet of Things could help to create loops throughout to recapture value that would otherwise be lost.

The circular economy is a name for a way we can reuse and recycle products so we don’t rely so much on the materials on earth that are not products yet. IoT could help us in a way to detect problems on/in products which makes maintenance easier. If a washing machine for example says where it needs to be fixed, in most cases it will be fixed instead of thrown away. If it is thrown away, IoT could make the recycling process easier by implementing it in sorting machines and give a clear view on what is usable or not and how much you have got of the material etc.

### Describe how the Internet of Things could enable the Circular Economy through the implementation of technologies, with repurpose and re-use in mind, in the design and production of our products.

Implementing IoT in products could be helpful because the product itself can say where and how it needs to be fixed and what task it still can do.

### Explain how the Internet of Things could help the Circular Economy to grow at a faster pace.

Of course the economy where we are now couldn't be fixed in a day. By starting to use IoT in the circular economy, people can see that it works and many investments will be made. What they can do and should do is by starting to make these machines of the materials they recycled to show that it works and make more machines that can do that without using brand new materials.
